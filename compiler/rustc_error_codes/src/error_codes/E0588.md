A type with `packed` representation hint has a field with `align`
representation hint.

Code example:

```compile_fail,E0588
#![deny(align_in_packed)]

#[repr(align(16))]
struct Aligned(i32);

#[repr(packed)] // error!
struct Packed(Aligned);
```

A `packed` type containing a type with the `align` representation hint may
not respect the `align` representation hint, just like how other fields of a `packed` type may be unaligned.
However, you can do the opposite:

```
#[repr(packed)]
struct Packed(i32);

#[repr(align(16))] // ok!
struct Aligned(Packed);
```
